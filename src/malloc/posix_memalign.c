/**

 * and `errno` is unspecified.
 * 
 * As a GNU-compliant slibc extension, memory allocated

 * 
 * @etymology  (POSIX)-extension: (mem)ory alignment.
 * 
 * @param   ptrptr    Output parameter for the allocated memory.
 * @param   boundary  The alignment.
 * @param   size      The number of bytes to allocated.
 * @return            Zero on success, a value for `errno` on error.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process cannot allocate more memory.
 * @throws  EINVAL  If `boundary` is not a power-of-two multiple of `sizeof(void*)`.

 * @since  Always.
