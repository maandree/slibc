/**
 * This function is identical to `free`.

 * 
 * This function uses variadic arguments because there
 * there are multiple conflicting specifications for `cfree`.
 * 
 * As a slibc extension, `errno` is guaranteed not to be set.
 * 
 * @param  ptr  Pointer to the beginning of the memory allocation.
 *              The process may crash if it does not point to the
 *              beginning of a memory allocation on the heap.
 *              However, if it is `NULL`, nothing will happen.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
