/**
 * This function is identical to `memalign`,
 * except it can be freed with `free`.
 * 
 * Variant of `malloc` that returns an address with a
 * specified alignment.
 * 
 * It is unspecified how the function works. This implemention
 * will allocate a bit of extra memory and shift the returned
 * pointer so that it is aligned.
 * 
 * @etymology  (Aligned) memory (alloc)ation.
 * 
 * @param   boundary  The alignment.
 * @param   size      The number of bytes to allocated.
 * @return            Pointer to the beginning of the new allocation.
 *                    If `size` is zero, this function will either return
 *                    `NULL` (that is what this implement does) or return
 *                    a unique pointer that can later be freed with `free`.
 *                    `NULL` is returned on error, and `errno` is set to
 *                    indicate the error.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process cannot allocate more memory.
 * @throws  EINVAL  If `boundary` is not a power of two.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
