/**
 * Variant of `malloc` that extends, or shrinks, an existing allocation,
 * if beneficial and possible, or creates a new allocation with the new
 * size, copies the data, and frees the old allocation. The returned
 * pointer has an alignment usable for any compiler-independent intrinsic
 * data type, if a new pointer is returned.
 * 
 * On error, `ptr` is not freed.
 * 
 * @etymology  Memory (realloc)ation.
 * 
 * @param   ptr   Pointer to the beginning of the old memory allocation.
 *                The process may crash if it does not point to the
 *                beginning of a memory allocation on the heap.
 *                However, if it is `NULL`, this function will behave
 *                like `malloc`.
 * @param   size  The new allocation size. If zero, this function will
 *                behave like `free`, and will return `NULL`.
 * @return        Pointer to the beginning of the new allocation.
 *                If `size` is zero, `NULL` is returned. On error `NULL`
 *                is returned and `errno` is set to indicate the error.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process cannot allocate more memory.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
