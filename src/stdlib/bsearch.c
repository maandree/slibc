/**
 * Search for an item in a sorted list of comparable
 * elements. The list must be sorted in ascending order.
 * The function usually implements binary search,
 * as is done in this implementation.
 * 
 * @etymology  (B)inary (search).
 * 
 * @param   sought  The sought item.
 * @param   list    The beginning of the list to search.
 * @param   n       The number of elements in the list.
 * @param   width   The width, in bytes, of each element in the list.
 * @param   compar  A function that shall compare two items, and return
 *                  a value less than, equal to, or greater than zero
 *                  if the first argument is less than, equal to, or
 *                  greater than the second argument, respectively.
 * @return          The address of an arbritrart element in `list` that
 *                  is equal to `sought`, or `NULL` if no such element
 *                  can be found (does not exist, or because `list`
 *                  is not properly sorted.)
 * 
 * @since  Always.
