 * @param  status  The process will exit, with the function returning, with this

 * @param  errnum  The value of `errno` when the error occurred, zero if the a textual
 *                 description of the error, further than that of `format`, shall not
 *                 be printed.
 * @param  format  Formatting-string for a detailed description of what happend.
 * @param  args    Formatting-arguments for `format`.
