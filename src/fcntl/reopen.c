/**
 * Reopen a file via its file descriptor. The old file descriptor
 * is closed and replace with the new open file descriptor.
 * 
 * This function call is different from the `dup` function-family
 * in two ways: (1) you can select news flags, for example, if
 * `fd` was read-only, the new file descriptor can be write-only,
 * and (2) the file descriptor is not duplicated, the file is
 * reopened.
 * 
 * This function is useful if you want to reopen a file you do
 * now know the pathname, you do not want to create a new string
 * with the pathname, or if the the file no longer has a pathname
 * because it has been unlinked.
 * 
 * Because the file is reopened, the file position is reset and
 * is not shared with any duplicates of `fd`, unlike a call to
 * dup(3). it is visible to the filesystem as a new open file
 * descriptor and is distinguished from the duplocates of `fd`,
 * and all file locks associated with `fd` are lost, except for
 * on the duplicates of `fd`, which means that you can create
 * new locks without removing locks from the duplicates of `fd`.
 * 
 * This is a slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  (Reopen) file!
 * 
 * @param   fd     The file descriptor.
 * @param   oflag  How the file shall be opened, see open(3).
 *                 `O_CREAT` is not allowed.
 * @return         Zero on success, -1 on error.
 * 
 * @throws  EINVAL  `oflag` contains `O_CREAT`.
 * @throws  EINVAL  `fd` is negative.
 * @throws          Any error specified for open(3).
 * @throws          Any error specified for dup2(3).
 * 
 * @since  Always.
