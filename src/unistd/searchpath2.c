/**
 * Search the environment variable $PATH for an executable
 * file whose name is the specified name. Slashes are ignored
 * and treated as any other character. $PATH is searched
 * for left to right, and ':' is used as the path-delimiter.
 * If $PATH is not defined, a fallback value for $PATH will be
 * used.
 * 
 * $PATH is not inspected if `name` starts with './', '../', or '/'.
 * 
 * This function was added because it was useful in implementing
 * the `exec`-function family.
 * 
 * This is a slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  Variant of (searchpath) that takes (2) arguments.
 * 
 * @param   name      The name of the sought executable. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param   fallback  Value to use instead of the value of $PATH, if
 *                    path is not defined. If `NULL` the default value
 *                    for $PATH is used.
 * @return            The pathname of the sought file, `NULL` on error,
 *                    or if not found. Files that are not executable
 *                    are (almost) ignored.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process cannot allocate enough memory.
 * @throws  ENOENT  There are no directories listed in $PATH, or
 *                  the sought file is not exist inside $PATH.
 * @throws  EACCES  None of the candidates (with at least one candidate)
 *                  are executable by the current user.
 * @throws          Any exception defined for access(3), except for `EROFS`,
 *                  these when encountered, the search is aborted, unless
 *                  the error is `ENOENT` or `EACCES`.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
