/**
 * Variant of `pwrite` that will write until all given
 * data has been written. This function will block signals
 * so that it cannot throw `EINTR`, which could mean that
 * you do not know how much data has been successfully
 * written. Note however, it may fail for any other reason
 * resulting in the same problem.
 * 
 * This is a slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  Variant of `(pwrite)` that writes all `(n)byte` bytes!
 * 
 * @param  fd      The file descriptor whither the data shall be write.
 * @param  buf     The data to write.
 * @param  nbyte   The number of bytes to write.
 * @param  offset  Whence in the file the write begins.
 * 
 * @throws  Any error specified for pwrite(3), except `EINTR`.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
