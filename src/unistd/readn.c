 * data to read. This function will block signals so
 * that it cannot throw `EINTR`, which could mean that

 * 
 * This is a Plan 9 from Bell Labs compliant slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  (Read) all `(n)byte` bytes!
 * 
 * @param  fd     The file descriptor whence the data shall be read.
 * @param  buf    The buffer whither the read data shall be stored.
 * @param  nbyte  The number of bytes to read.
 * 
 * @throws  Any error specified for read(3), except `EINTR`.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
