/**
 * Variant of `write` that will write until all given
 * data has been written. This function will block signals
 * so that it cannot throw `EINTR`, which could mean that
 * you do not know how much data has been successfully
 * written. Note however, it may fail for any other reason
 * resulting in the same problem.
 * 
 * This is a slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  (Write) all `(n)byte` bytes!
 * 
 * @param  fd     The file descriptor whither the data shall be write.
 * @param  buf    The data to write.
 * @param  nbyte  The number of bytes to write.
 * 
 * @throws  Any error specified for write(3), except `EINTR`.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
