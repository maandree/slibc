/**
 * Search the environment variable $PATH for an executable
 * file whose name is the specified name. Slashes are ignored
 * and treated as any other character. $PATH is searched
 * for left to right, and ':' is used as the path-delimiter.
 * 
 * $PATH is not inspected if `name` starts with './', '../', or '/'.
 * 
 * This is a Plan 9 from Bell Labs compliant slibc extension.
 * 
 * @etymology  (Search) ($PATH) for an executable.
 * 
 * @param   name  The name of the sought executable.
 * @return        The pathname of the sought file, `NULL` on error,
 *                or if not found. Files that are not executable
 *                are (almost) ignored.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process cannot allocate enough memory.
 * @throws  ENOENT  $PATH is not defined, there are no directories
 *                  listed in $PATH, or the sought file is not
 *                  exist inside $PATH.
 * @throws  EACCES  None of the candidates (with at least one candidate)
 *                  are executable by the current user.
 * @throws          Any exception defined for access(3), except for `EROFS`,
 *                  these when encountered, the search is aborted, unless
 *                  the error is `ENOENT` or `EACCES`.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
