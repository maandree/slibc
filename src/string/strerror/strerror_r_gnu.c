 * However it is not defined if _SLIBC_SOURCE is defined.
 * 
 * @param   errnum  The error code.
 * @param   buf     Buffer where the description shall be stored.
 * @param   buflen  The allocation size of `buf`.
 * @return          `buf` on success, `NULL` on error. On error, `errno`
 *                  is set to indicate the error.
 * 
 * @throws  ERANGE  `buf` was too small to store the description.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
