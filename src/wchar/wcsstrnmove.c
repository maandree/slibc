/**
 * Copy a memory segment to another, possibly overlapping, segment,
 * stop when a NUL wide character or a specified substring is encountered.
 * 
 * This is a slibc extension added for completeness.
 * It is only available if GNU extensions are available.
 * 
 * @param   whither  The destination memory segment.
 * @param   whence   The source memory segment.
 * @param   str      The substring, ignored if `NULL`.
 * @param   maxlen   The maximum number of wide characters to copy.
 *                   NOTE that if the resulting string at least this
 *                   long, no NUL character will be written to `whither'.
 *                   On the otherhand, if the resultnig string is
 *                   shorter, `whither` will be filled with NUL characters
 *                   until this amount of characters have been written.
 * @return           `NULL` if `str` was not encountered, otherwise
 *                   the position of `str` translated to `whither`,
 *                   that is, the address of `whither` plus the
 *                   number of copied chartacters; the address of
 *                   one character passed the last written non-NUL
 *                   character.
 * 
 * @since  Always.
