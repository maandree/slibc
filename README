NAME
	slibc - the Stockholm C Standard Library

DESCRIPTION
	slibc is a POSIX C standard library. It aims to support
	ISO C99, and newer versions of ISO C, other versions of C
	are ignored except for proper feature-test macros. Ignores
	all languages other than C, this means that slibc cannot be
	used in C++ by merely including the header files.

	In addition to POSIX, slibc aims to support common
	extensions, especially those in the GNU C Library because of
	its predominance on GNU systems. slibc also aims to fill the
	lacunæ in the C standard library specification, and make
	programming in C even easier by adding functions that would
	be generally useful are impossible to implement efficiently
	in other libraries.

FEATURE-TEST MACROS
	slibc defines a few slibc-specified feature-test macros:

	_SLIBC_SOURCE
		Enable slibc extensions. These extensions are
		often extensions introduced in other C libraries,
		but are considered good extensions.

		slibc provides some slibc-specific extensions that
		do not require _SLIBC_SOURCE. (They are however
		disabled if _PORTABLE_SOURCE or _LIBRARY_HEADER are
		defined.) These extensions are defined in header
		files whose name starts with 'slibc-'. Headers
		starting with 'slibc/' are not extensions, those are
		internals that may change at any time.

	_SLIBC_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS
		Suppress all #warning and other warnings, this is
		primarily intended to be used when compiling slibc.

	_PORTABLE_SOURCE
		Unconditionally disable all non-POSIX extensions, and
		otherwise help ensure that the source is portable.

	_LIBRARY_HEADER
		Alternative to _PORTABLE_SOURCE that should be used in
		header files for libraries. This allows you to be sure
		that your library is portable between libc:s, and that
		sources using your library does not been to be compiled
		with the same libc. It is important to use this instead
		of _PORTABLE_SOURCE in library header files, otherwise
		the user of the library cannot fully utilise
		_PORTABLE_SOURCE.

COMMENTS
	Writing a C standard library is a massive task. As I only have
	x86_64 hardware, I will require help write the assembly code
	for other hardware. I also need help writing the texinfo manual
	and example code for functions, help figuring out the correct
	feature-test macros for all functions, their etymology, and in
	which libc implementions they appear. Help optimising all
	functions would also be appreciated.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The macro _SMALL_BINARY shall whenever available, create
       macros that make the program use implementions of the functions
       that optimised for size rather than performance. It should
       be compile-time selectable whether this macro has any effect,
       or if it is always in effect. _FAST_BINARY could also be added
       to make the program use fast implementions when the library
       is compiled to use the size optimised implementations.

RATIONALE
	slibc is written as a learning exercise, and for fun.
