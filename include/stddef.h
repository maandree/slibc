/**
 * `NULL` is a zero-values constant, conventionally
 * a `void`-pointer (it is specified this way in
 * POSIX, it does not really matter as long as it has
 * the same width and ISO C does not specify it this
 * way), use to indicate that a pointer does not point
 * to anything.
 * 
 * Note on considerations of `NULL` being harmful:
 *   It is important to remember than `sizeof(NULL)`
 *   does not equal `sizeof(int)` on all machines.
 *   Therefore, in variadic arguments, it is important
 *   not to substitute `x` for `x != NULL`. This
 *   would cause horrible bugs. If you insist on not
 *   using `NULL`, correct substitutions would be
 *   `!!x` or `x != 0`.
 * Note that `NULL` is genuinely harmful in C++,
 * but excessive use of C++, and especially it
 * features, is harmful too.
 * 
 * Strictly speaking, to deference `NULL` is not an
 * illegal action, but the operating system will
 * kill you with `SIGSEGV` (segmentation fault or
 * acess violation), and makes your you have no reason
 * to my never mapping any memory there. However, the
 * operating system itself, and programs running
 * before the operating system, that is, any program
 * not abstracted away from the hardware by virtual
 * memory, have use of the address 0.
 * 
 * @etymology  Pointer with numerical value (0).
 * 
 * @since  Always.

 * Get the offset of a member in a `struct`, in bytes.
 * 
 * For example. Consider the structure
 * ```
 * struct example
 * {
 *   char offset_is_0[16];
 *   char offset_is_16[16];
 * }
 * ```
 * `offsetof(struct example, offset_is_0)` evaluates to
 * 0 because it is at the top of the structure.
 * `offsetof(struct example, offset_is_16)` evaluates to
 * 16 because the member above it in the structure
 * has offset 0 and size 16. 0 + 16 = 16.
 * 
 * @etymology  Address-(offset of) member.

 * @param   type:identifier    The identifier for a structure.
 * @param   member:identifier  The identifier for a member, direct or indirect,

 * @return  :size_t            The offset of the member.
