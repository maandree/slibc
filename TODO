It should be possible to configure malloc, calloc, and
realloc to allocate some extra space. This is usable
for single-threaded allocations; they do not need to
realloc strings returned by functions with
__attribute__((malloc)), to append a string or character.

    _GNU_SOURCE, system-dependant
  void* extalloca(void* p, size_t extent) :: extend alloca-allocation
    requires that nothing has been allocated to the stack since p.
    difficult to implement as a function.
    as a macro:
      ({ void* q = alloca(extent); (long int)q < (long int)p ? q : p; })
  void* dealloca(size_t amount)
    deallocate the last amount bytes allocated to the stack
  void* zalloca(size_t size)
    difficult to implement as a function.
    as a macro:
      ({ void* p = alloca(size); memset(p, 0, size); })

The width of intptr_t  should be determined by sizeof(void*),
the width of size_t    should be determined by sizeof(sizeof(0)), and
the width of ptrdiff_t should be determined by sizeof(NULL - NULL);
